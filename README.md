# C-plus-plus-programming
Srt of exercised solved in C++.

    Lab 1:
  1) Program that asks the user to input 3 sides of a triangle, a, b and c. Program then informs user whether or not a triangle can be constructed with the given sides. If it is possible to form a triangle with the entered sides, the program outputs the perimeter and area of the triangle.
  
  2) Program asks user for the length of a dynamic array. After creating the array it fills it with values given by the user, displays the whole array, displays smallest and biggest value, displays the arithmetic average and displays the array in reversed order.
    
  3) Program asks user for the length of two dynamic square matrices, A and B. After creating the matrices it fills them with values given by the user, displays A and B, displays A+B and displays A*B.
  
    Lab 2:
  1) Define the class ShoppingCart supporting multi-item shoppings. The class should contain the following fields: a customer name and two arrays/lists of the same size (empty by default) – the first for product names (being strings) and the second one for costs (being real numbers) of the subsequent products. Implement the following public methods of the class :
  
        • the constructor with a string as a parameter being a customer name,
        • the copy-constructor and the assignment operator,
        • the destructor,
        • setCustomer and getCustomer methods,
        • addItem – with a product name as the first parameter (being string) and its cost as the second parameter (being a real value),
        • removeItem – with a product name as a parameter, removing the item from the the cart together with its cost (or throwing an error if the product is not in the cart),
        • size – returning the number of items in the shopping cart,
        • totalCost – returning the total cost of all the items in the cart,
        • getItemCount – returning the summary count of all the items in all the shopping carts currently available,
        • the indexing operator ([]) – with a product name as a parameter, returning the cost of the product placed within the cart (an error should be thrown for the product name not existing in the cart),
        • the shift operator (<<) – printing t
