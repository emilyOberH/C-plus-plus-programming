# C-plus-plus-programming
Srt of exercised solved in C++.

    Lab 1:
  1) Program that asks the user to input 3 sides of a triangle, a, b and c. Program then informs user whether or not a triangle can be constructed with the given sides. If it is possible to form a triangle with the entered sides, the program outputs the perimeter and area of the triangle.
  
  2) Program asks user for the length of a dynamic array. After creating the array it fills it with values given by the user, displays the whole array, displays smallest and biggest value, displays the arithmetic average and displays the array in reversed order.
    
  2) Program asks user for the length of two dynamic square matrices, A and B. After creating the matrices it fills them with values given by the user, displays A and B, displays A+B and displays A*B.
